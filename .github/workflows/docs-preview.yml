name: Documentation preview
# Purpose: When someone opens a PR, build the docs and deploy a live preview so reviewers
# can see exactly how the documentation will look before merging (links, formatting, API
# reference, etc.) instead of having to build locally. The preview URL is posted as a PR comment.
# Runs on PRs targeting main or development so previews are available for both flows.
# Requires NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN and NETLIFY_SITE_ID repository secrets (see README).
