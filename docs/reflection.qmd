title: "Tools, Infrastructure, and Practices"

## Project Overview

This document reflects on the tools, infrastructure, and development practices adopted for the `imitation-game` project. Our goal was to create a robust, secure, and maintainable Python package for cryptographic operations, adhering to modern software engineering best practices.

## Tools Used

We utilized a suite of diverse tools to ensure code quality, reliability, and ease of distribution:

### 1. **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**
   - **Role:** Automates our testing, linting, documentation building, and publishing workflows.
   - **Benefit:** Ensures that every pull request is verified before merging, preventing regressions and maintaining high code standards.

### 2. **Pytest & Codecov**
   - **Role:** Unit and integration testing framework combined with coverage reporting.
   - **Benefit:** Provides confidence in our cryptographic implementations. Codecov integration gives us visibility into untested code paths, driving our coverage metrics.

### 3. **Poetry / Hatch / Pyproject.toml**
   - **Role:** Dependency management and packaging.
   - **Benefit:** Standardizes our build system. We use `pyproject.toml` as the single source of truth for project metadata and dependencies.

### 4. **Quartodoc & Quarto**
   - **Role:** Auto-generating API documentation and rendering the documentation website.
   - **Benefit:** Keeps our documentation in sync with our code docstrings automatically, reducing manual maintenance effort.

### 5. **Semantic Release**
   - **Role:** Automated versioning and changelog generation.
   - **Benefit:** Eliminates manual version management. Commits following Conventional Commits specification trigger automatic version bumps (patch/minor/major) and release notes.
